# tasklist 

v1.0

This is my implementation of test task for Java Developer vacancy

Current application is task manager that interacts with uset through command line.

After start of application you can see Main Menu of the application with 5 items:
[1] SHOW ALL TASKS
[2] ADD NEW TASK
[3] SHOW ALL PROJECTS
[4] ADD NEW PROJECT
[5] QUIT
If you choose 1 item application show you list of all undone tasks with detailed information about them. 
In this view you can interact with application by text commands (all of them will be list bellow). For getting tips
just type "help" and you will see list of all available commands
